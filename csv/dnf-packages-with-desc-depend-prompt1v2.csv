This makes it simple to write to a file atomically just by using the mv operation. However, this will destroy the permissions on the original file. This library does the following to preserve permissions while atomically writing to a file:  * If an original file exists, take those permissions and apply them to the temp file before `mv`ing the file into place.  * If the original file does not exist, create a following with default permissions (based on the currently-active umask).  This way, when the file is `mv`'ed into place, the permissions will be the ones held by the original file.  This library is based on similar implementations found in common libraries in Ruby and Python:  * <http://apidock.com/rails/File/atomic_write/class Ruby on Rails includes a similar method called atomic_write>  * <https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/c4631816132fcfefaba3d123a1d0dfe8bc2866bb/lib/chef/file_content_management/deploy/mv_unix.rb#L23:L71 Chef includes atomic update functionality>  * <https://github.com/sashka/atomicfile There is a python library for atomically updating a file>  To use `atomic-write`, import the module corresponding to the type you wish to write atomically, e.g., to write a (strict) ByteString atomically:  > import System.AtomicWrite.Writer.ByteString  Then you can use the atomicWriteFile function that accepts a `FilePath` and a `ByteString`, e.g.:  > atomicWriteFile myFilePath myByteString.

With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.  Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure channel, can then communicate with any Notary server or (insecure) mirror, relying only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity of the received content.

Even worse: if an editor saves BOM (Byte Order Mark, U+FEFF character in Unicode) at the start of a script with the executable bit set (on Unix systems), it won't execute at all, due to shebang corruption.  Avoiding codification problems is quite simple:  * Always use utf8/use common::sense when saving source as UTF-8 * Always specify =encoding utf8 when saving POD as UTF-8 * Do neither of above when saving as ISO-8859-1 * Never save BOM (not that it's wrong; just avoid it as you'll barely notice its presence when in trouble)  However, if you find yourself upgrading old code to use UTF-8 or trying to standardize a big project with many developers, each one using a different platform/editor, reviewing all files manually can be quite painful, especially in cases where some files have multiple encodings (note: it all started when I realized that gedit and derivatives are unable to open files with character conversion tables).

It is a useful utility to have around when you have to convert files between MSDOS (or Windows) and Unix/Linux/BSD (and her clones and variants).

"tor","0.4.8.13","The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. Tor can also be used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.  This package contains the Tor software that can act as either a server on the Tor network, or as a client to connect to the Tor network.

"trojita","0.7.0.1","Trojitá is a IMAP e-mail client which: * Enables you to access your mail anytime, anywhere. * Does not slow you down. If we can improve the productivity of an e-mail user, we better do. * Respects open standards and facilitates modern technologies. We value the vendor-neutrality that IMAP provides and are committed to be as inter-operable as possible. * Is efficient — be it at conserving the network bandwidth, keeping memory use at a reasonable level or not hogging the system's CPU. * Can be used on many platforms. One UI is not enough for everyone, but our IMAP core works fine on anything from desktop computers to cell phones and big ERP systems. * Plays well with the rest of the ecosystem. We don't like reinventing wheels, but when the existing wheels quite don't fit the tracks, we're not afraid of making them work.  This application is heavily based on Qt and uses WebKit.

"uwsgi","2.0.28","uWSGI is a fast (pure C), self-healing, developer/sysadmin-friendly application container server.  Born as a WSGI-only server, over time it has evolved in a complete stack for networked/clustered web applications, implementing message/object passing, caching, RPC and process management. It uses the uwsgi (all lowercase, already included by default in the Nginx and Cherokee releases) protocol for all the networking/interprocess communications.  Can be run in preforking mode, threaded, asynchronous/evented and supports various form of green threads/co-routine (like uGreen and Fiber).  Sysadmin will love it as it can be configured via command line, environment variables, xml, .ini and yaml files and via LDAP. Being fully modular can use tons of different technology on top of the same core.
