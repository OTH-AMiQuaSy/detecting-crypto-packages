Description: {description}

Return a CSV line where:
* Column 1: Package name.
* Column 2: "True" if the package implements cryptographic functions natively. "False" if it delegates all cryptographic functions to external libraries or does not involve cryptography.
* Column 3: A short explanation of why the package was marked "True" or "False".

Important Notes:
* Consider "implementing cryptography natively" to mean that the package contains its own cryptographic algorithms or protocols, **NOT** relying exclusively on external libraries like **OpenSSL, NSS, BoringSSL, or GnuTLS**.
* quote all columns
* suppress error messages
* do not add a header
